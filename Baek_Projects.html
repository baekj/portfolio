                            <p>The Slow Fade LED Circuit was an individual project in which the objective was to ultimately
                                create my own printed circuit board (PCB). In order to do this, I had to define a circuit,
                                test it on a breadboard, simulate it using the program
                                <a href="http://www.ni.com/multisim/">NI Multisim</a>,

                                etch it, and solder the components on myself. Through this process, I was able to learn about
                                the creation of PCB's as well as how to develop and refine a circuit. The circuit's design was

                                construction of the physical model. My research dealt with the need for our product, such as statistics on water scarcity.
