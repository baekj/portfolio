                            <p> Hello, my name is Joanne Baek. I am currently a high school senior attending Dublin High School. While peanut
                            butter and jelly is a sweet combination, I find biology and engineering to be even better! Thus, I plan 
                            on studying chemical & biomolecular engineering at Johns Hopkins Univeristy this coming fall. My participation in 
                            the Dublin Engineering and Design Academy has played an integral role in shaping my career goals. Right now I am enrolled 
                            in the Digital Electronics (DE) course, where I learn about circuits and eventually build my own computer. In the past,
                            I have taken the Computer Science/Software Engineering (CSE) course as well as the Principles of Engineering (POE) course 
                            through the academy. </p>
                            
                            <p>Some major accomplishments of my high school career are receiving both the Academic Block D and Honor Pin, 
                            co-founding two clubs, and being a California Scholarship Federation Lifetime Member. The majority of my classes 
                            are rigorous and geared towards my future career. Due to their level of difficulty, I have often pushed myself to improve
                            my work ethic and mindset. For example, POE taught me to be comfortable working in a team and presenting in front of 
                            the class, both of which I was hesistant to do before. </p>
                            
                            <p>Everything that I do, whether I am volunteering in Nepal or studying in my room, has made me who I am today: tenacious,
                            dedicated, and meticulous. As I mature and prepare for college, I am slowly learning to balance several aspects of my 
                            life at once while putting my best efforts into all of them. Please feel free to explore the rest of my website to 
                            learn all about these different facets.</p>
